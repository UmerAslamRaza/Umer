**Multi-Language Support (i18n):**  
Using Laravel's built-in localization, the platform provides full support for both English and Arabic languages, delivering a smooth experience for local users and international visitors alike.

**SEO Optimization:**  
Every event page is structured with SEO-friendly meta tags, Open Graph (OG) social preview cards, clean URLs, and automatic sitemap generation. Schema.org structured data markup enhances visibility across platforms like Google Events and search engines.

**Interactive Calendar + Filters:**  
An intuitive, interactive calendar view enables users to browse events by date. In addition, users can filter events based on type, audience, and location or search using date ranges and keywords, providing a tailored discovery experience.

**Mobile Responsiveness:**  
The UI was designed mobile-first to ensure optimal performance across all devices. Enhancements like lazy-loading images and asset minification ensure fast load times and a seamless mobile browsing experience.

**Admin Dashboard & Role Management:**  
The backend includes a role-based dashboard allowing admins to manage events, homepage banners, newsletters, and contact form responses. Multiple admin levels—such as event manager, content editor, and super admin—help delegate control efficiently across teams.

**Lokal** is a custom-built, Shopify-integrated e-commerce solution designed to streamline complex product creation and management processes for a multi-category retail business. 

The core goal was to empower non-technical staff to manage products, variations, and inventory without needing to rely entirely on Shopify's native backend, which can be overwhelming for such use cases. Instead, a bespoke Laravel + Vue.js admin dashboard was developed, offering an intuitive, business-specific interface that communicates directly with Shopify’s Storefront and Admin APIs. This allowed the client’s team to create, modify, and organize product data efficiently—all from a single tailored environment.

**Advanced Shopify Integration:**  
The platform leverages Shopify's Admin API to manage products, variants, collections, pricing, inventory, and images. OAuth authentication ensures secure access to the Shopify ecosystem, while Laravel Jobs and Queues enable real-time asynchronous data syncing.

**Custom Product Creation Tool:**  
A dynamic interface was built to simplify product creation. Users can define multiple product variants (e.g., size, material, color), upload multiple images, set SKUs, apply price rules and discounts, and configure fulfillment and inventory logic—all in one flow.

**Tailored Admin Dashboard:**  
The Laravel + Vue.js dashboard mimics the simplicity of Shopify but is fully customized to the business needs. Admins can manage product visibility, create or edit tags and collections, and perform bulk updates. Batch image uploading and product filtering by category or collection enhance efficiency.

**Bidirectional Sync:**  
Changes made within Shopify—such as pricing adjustments or out-of-stock status—are automatically reflected in the Laravel admin. Webhooks are used to detect and sync these updates in real time, ensuring consistency across platforms.

**Order Management:**  
A minimal order monitoring page provides visibility into order ID, customer details, payment status, and fulfillment progress. This data is pulled via the Shopify Orders API to keep admin users informed and responsive to customer needs.

**Interactive Map Integration:**  
Built using Google Maps API (or Leaflet.js), the platform visualizes school data geographically with interactive markers, hoverable tooltips, and modal popups showing tuition, ratings, contact info, and more.

**Advanced Filtering for Parents:**  
Parents can search and filter schools based on multiple criteria including:
- School name
- Curriculum type (British, IB, etc.)
- Education level (Primary, Secondary)
- Gender (Co-ed, Boys, Girls)
- Proximity (radius-based location filter)

Each school marker links to a detailed profile page featuring rich content, image galleries, and a contact form for direct inquiries.

**Investor-Focused Analytics Interface:**  
A separate view provides investors with data-rich insights like:
- School density and capacity analysis
- Regional performance trends
- Color-coded heatmaps indicating underserved or high-growth educational zones
- Demographic overlays (e.g., concentration of school-aged children)

**Dynamic Data Upload & Visualization:**  
Admins can upload regional datasets (CSV/Excel) which are parsed and rendered directly on the map in real time. Each region is interactive, offering overlays with metrics such as:
- School-to-student ratio
- Average tuition fees
- Academic performance indicators
- Land availability for future school development

The platform thus provides an all-in-one tool for both school discovery and education-sector investment strategy.

### Free ECAs
- No additional cost, available to all interested students.
- Enrollment is done via the Parent Portal by submitting student interest.
- Due to high demand, spots are allocated either:
  - On a first-come, first-served basis.
  - Or by ECA coordinators based on capacity.
- Parents receive email confirmation if selected; otherwise, students are added to a waiting list.

### Paid ECAs
- Premium activities requiring payment at the time of registration.
- Payment and enrollment managed directly through the Parent Portal.
- Email confirmation sent upon successful payment.
- These ECAs often include:
  - Specialized coaching
  - Advanced skills development
  - Access to external events and competitions

### Parent Portal Workflow
1. **Login:** Use existing credentials (new parents can get assistance from the school office).
2. **Browse Activities:** Filter ECAs by age group and interest.
3. **Enroll:** Submit interest (Free ECAs) or pay and confirm (Paid ECAs).
4. **Confirmation:** Receive email confirmation or waitlist status.

This user-friendly system centralizes all extracurricular registrations, helping parents easily manage their child’s enrichment journey.

I led the development of the PDP & FRC Portal — a comprehensive web-based staff development and performance management platform built for educational institutions.

This portal centralizes user roles, growth plans, and professional learning activities for teachers, leadership, and support staff. It supports two primary user roles:

- **Super Admins**: Full backend access to manage users, permissions, documents, and system-wide settings.
- **Normal Users**: Sign in via institutional Google accounts to access features specific to their role.

The platform is structured around interactive tabs and role-based categories such as:
- Support Staff / Leaders
- Teachers / Teacher Assistants
- Leadership Roles

Each category addresses critical development areas:
- Pedagogical Focus
- Leadership Development
- Personal & Professional Growth
- Climate & Culture
- Lesson Observations
- Action Research

Users can track progress, upload resources, share with collaborators, comment, and move tasks through statuses — from draft to submission — supporting accountability and collaboration.

- **Lesson Observations**: Supports self-reflection, peer reviews, and line manager evaluations using customizable templates and rubrics. Observations can be saved as drafts or formally submitted with feedback and comment control.
- **Professional Development & Strategic Priorities**: Structured templates help align personal goals with institutional strategy — tracking learning outcomes, next steps, and growth metrics.
- **Lesson Observation Dashboard**: Interactive charts provide a visual overview of observation trends, helping leadership track performance across departments.
- **Team Management View**: Managers can see a live view of the hierarchy and staff progress, review submissions, and offer feedback.
- **Leadership-Only Features**: Senior Leadership Team (SLT) members have access to privileged features such as initiating new observations, scheduling “Pop-In” visits, and using an overview calendar.
- **Google Drive Integration**: Users access role-specific documents and resources via embedded Google Drive folders. Visibility and permissions are managed by Super Admins.
  
This system required:
- Deep implementation of **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Complex UI/UX workflows for multi-role functionality
- Seamless integration with **Google Authentication** and **Google Drive**
- High-performance data handling

Close collaboration with educators ensured the portal addressed real-world needs, ultimately improving professional growth, transparency, and communication within the institution.
